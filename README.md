**The n8n for DeFi — Automate Everything Onchain**

[Launch App → orbfi-unite.netlify.app](https://orbfi-unite.netlify.app/)

OrbFi is the **n8n of decentralized finance** — a visual, modular platform to build and run autonomous DeFi agents called **Orbs**.

These Orbs let you automate onchain strategies using plug-and-play logic blocks. No code needed.

## 🧠 What Is OrbFi?

OrbFi makes DeFi automation as simple as connecting blocks in a flowchart.

You can:

- Monitor token prices across Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon
- Trigger trades based on custom logic (e.g. “If ETH drops 5% in 24h, buy $100 worth”)
- Add delays, loops, conditional triggers, and data flows
- Combine multiple DeFi actions into visual automations called Orbs

## 🔗 Powered by 1inch Fusion

At its core, OrbFi integrates directly with **1inch Fusion**, unlocking:

- **Gasless swaps** via 1inch’s Fusion mode
- **MEV protection** for secure execution
- **Cross-DEX optimal routing** for best prices
- **Simplified user experience** — agents trigger trades, not users

Every swap your Orb performs is backed by 1inch’s infrastructure, making your DeFi workflows powerful, seamless, and trustless.

## 🧪 Example Workflows

- Auto-buy ETH if it dips below $2500
- DCA into stablecoins weekly
- Bridge tokens + swap + stake — all in one flow
- Chain triggers across multiple chains using logic gates and oracles

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS + ReactFlow
- **Execution Layer**: Stateless agents that ping APIs and trigger DeFi actions
- **Swap Engine**: 1inch Fusion API
- **Hosting**: Serverless (Netlify)
